## Protein characterization

We distinguish three goals in protein characterization

* Estimation of site occupancy

* Differential site occupancy determination

* Estimation of combined occupancy

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Goal 1: site occupancy estimation


## Goal 1: differential site occupancy


## Goal 3: combined occupancy estimation
